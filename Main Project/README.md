# This was my first hackathon ever
It might not be much, but we tried our best. My two other friends who were with me at the hackathon did not know python, only java and typescript.
They helped brainstorm some of the ideas for the project, and I coded it all up in python.
This was attempted after only about 1.5 months of total coding experience in any language so it is not very impressive, but it is the best we could do.
